# countdown

Ever wondered in how long things are happening, but lack the ability to compute these in your own brain? Don't worry me too.

Do you want to add an event? Please create an issue using the [issue template](https://github.com/Mavulp/countdown/issues/new?assignees=dolanske&labels=&projects=&template=new-event.md&title=%5BRequest%5D+New+event) or you can create a pull request and modify the [events.ts](https://github.com/Mavulp/countdown/blob/main/src/events.ts) file directly.
